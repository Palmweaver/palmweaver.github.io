		<h2>
			My Name is Christopher Scalf, aka The Palmweaver
		</h2>
				
		<p>
			My nickname comes from the art that I've been practicing for over a decade and a half now. Based upon weaving patterns that are thousands of years old, I begin with simple palm leaves and turn them into visually striking creations ranging from small insects to complex hats and sculptures. You can see my art on the next tab and also purchase my art online.

			A little bit of old and new...

			I am a 3D artist, musician, historical re-enactor and web designer.  This week my main page will be focusing on some of my 3D design using 2020.
