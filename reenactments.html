			These are scenes from the "Lost Arts and Crafts Festival" at the Colonial Spanish Quarter and Drake's Raid in downtown Saint Augustine, Florida.  We have several annual events where re-live parts of the exciting timeline of America's oldest city.
		</p>
		<p>
			Founded in 1565, Saint Augustine has four and a half centuries of history.  Twice a year we have military re-enactments to celebrate pirate attacks that nearly destroyed the town, and we give the crowd quite a show.  There are many other historically accurate events throughout the year; a full schedule of them can be found at <a href="http://www.oldcity.com" target="_blank">www.oldcity.com</a>
